## Development Workflow & Documentation Standards

### Feature Completion Workflow
When completing features or development phases, ALWAYS follow this documentation update sequence:

1. **Complete the Implementation**
   - Finish coding, testing, and verification of the feature/phase
   - Ensure all CRUD operations, API endpoints, and business logic are working

2. **Update PROGRESS.md**
   - Update overall completion percentage
   - Mark completed tasks with ‚úÖ 
   - Add new milestones and achievement dates
   - Update "What's Working Now" and "What's Ready to Build" sections
   - Document any technical insights or implementation decisions

3. **Update PLAN.md** 
   - Update the implementation status section at the top
   - Mark completed phases/features with ‚úÖ in the roadmap
   - Update progress percentages for each phase
   - Add notes about features completed beyond the original plan
   - Update "Still Needed" sections with current priorities

4. **Update CLAUDE.md (if applicable)**
   - Update implementation status sections
   - Mark completed features with ‚úÖ
   - Update phase descriptions and priorities
   - Add new technical architecture details if infrastructure changed
   - Update development scripts if new commands were added

5. **Update README.md (if applicable)**
   - Update development status and implementation progress
   - Update tech stack or feature descriptions if significantly changed
   - Keep "What's Implemented & Working" section current

6. **Commit Documentation Updates**
   - Create a dedicated commit for documentation updates
   - Use descriptive commit messages like "docs: update progress after completing Phase 1 foundation"

### Documentation Consistency Rules
- **Status Indicators**: Use ‚úÖ for completed, üöß for in-progress, ‚ö†Ô∏è for pending/needed
- **Percentage Updates**: Keep percentages consistent across PROGRESS.md and PLAN.md  
- **Date Stamps**: Always update "Last Updated" dates when making changes
- **Cross-References**: Ensure all three docs reference the same completion status
- **Implementation Insights**: Document key decisions, challenges, and solutions in PROGRESS.md

### When to Update Documentation
- **After completing any major feature or system** (e.g., completing CRUD operations for a model)
- **After completing a development phase** (e.g., Phase 1: Foundation) 
- **After significant architectural changes** (e.g., adding new API routes, database migrations)
- **Before starting the next major development phase**
- **When implementation significantly exceeds or deviates from the original PLAN.md**
- **MANDATORY: After implementing any new model, API endpoint, or core functionality** - Documentation updates are not optional

### Documentation Update Priority
**CRITICAL**: Documentation updates must be treated as part of the implementation, not an afterthought. The feature is not considered complete until all relevant documentation (PROGRESS.md, PLAN.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md) accurately reflects the current state.

This workflow ensures project documentation always reflects current reality and provides accurate guidance for future development phases.

**Protected Routes (require authentication, under `/_layout`):**
- `/dashboard` - User dashboard after authentication ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- `/settings` - User settings page with tabs:
  - My profile (user information)
  - Password (change password)
  - Appearance (theme settings)
  - Danger zone (delete account) - hidden for superusers

**Future LFP Routes (To Be Implemented):**
- `/quests` - Quest board with MMO-style interface and tag-based filtering

## Key Implementation Principles

### Database Design
- **UUID Primary Keys**: Maintain existing UUID system for all models
- **Proper Relationships**: Use SQLModel relationships with cascade rules
- **Migration Strategy**: Alembic migrations with proper rollback testing
- **Indexing**: Strategic indexes for query performance
- **Enum Fields**: For enum fields with default values, always include `sa_column_kwargs={"server_default": EnumValue.DEFAULT.value}` to ensure PostgreSQL database-level defaults match SQLModel defaults
- **Forward References**: When using string annotations for forward references with Optional types, use `Optional["ModelName"]` instead of `"ModelName" | None` to avoid TypeError in Python < 3.10

### API Design Standards
- **REST Conventions**: Consistent endpoint naming and HTTP methods
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Auto-generated docs with examples
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses with helpful messages
- **Pagination**: Consistent pagination for list endpoints
- **Filtering**: Flexible filtering with query parameters

### Frontend Development
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable components with consistent props
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, Zustand for client state
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage
- **Testing Strategy**: E2E tests for user flows, unit tests for utilities
- **Performance**: Code splitting and lazy loading for optimal bundle size

## GitHub Actions Debugging Flow

When GitHub Actions fail (especially Playwright tests), use the MCP GitHub server to diagnose issues:

### Step 1: Get Current Branch Info
```
# Get current branch name
git branch --show-current

# If on feat/landing-page, we need to check workflows for this branch
```

### Step 2: List Workflow Runs for Current Branch
Use MCP GitHub server to get workflow runs filtered by branch:
```
mcp__github__list_workflow_runs
- owner: "chezzijr" 
- repo: "look-for-party"
- workflow_id: "playwright.yml" (or get workflow ID first)
- branch: "feat/landing-page" (or current branch)
- perPage: 10 (to limit results)
```

### Step 3: Get Failed Workflow Run Details
From the workflow runs list, identify the failed run ID and get details:
```
mcp__github__get_workflow_run
- owner: "chezzijr"
- repo: "look-for-party" 
- run_id: [failed_run_id]
```

### Step 4: Get Failed Job Logs (Most Efficient)
Use the efficient method to get only failed job logs:
```
mcp__github__get_job_logs
- owner: "chezzijr"
- repo: "look-for-party"
- run_id: [failed_run_id]
- failed_only: true
- return_content: true
- tail_lines: 500 (to limit output and focus on recent errors)
```

### Step 5: Identify Specific Test Failures
Look for patterns in the logs:
- `Error: page.waitForURL: Test timeout`
- Specific test file and line numbers
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Network/service issues

### Alternative: Get Specific Job Logs
If you need logs from a specific job:
1. First list jobs for the workflow run:
```
mcp__github__list_workflow_jobs
- owner: "chezzijr"
- repo: "look-for-party"  
- run_id: [failed_run_id]
```

2. Then get logs for specific failed job:
```
mcp__github__get_job_logs
- owner: "chezzijr"
- repo: "look-for-party"
- job_id: [specific_job_id]
- return_content: true
- tail_lines: 500
```

### Token Management Tips
- Use `perPage: 10` or smaller to limit results
- Use `tail_lines: 500` to get recent log content only  
- Use `failed_only: true` to focus on failed jobs
- Filter by current branch to avoid irrelevant results
- Use `return_content: true` to get actual log content vs URLs

### Common Playwright Test Issues to Look For
- Route expectation mismatches (e.g., expecting `/login` but getting `/`)
- Component selector changes
- Timing issues with `waitForURL` or element visibility
- Authentication flow changes
- Container startup issues in CI environment
