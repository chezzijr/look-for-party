## üß† Technical Insights & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Search Preferences as Request Parameters**: Successfully removed search preferences from User model (preferred_commitment_level, communication_style) - now passed as API request parameters for dynamic matching
- **Quest Simplification**: Removed complexity fields (difficulty_level, time_commitment, is_urgent) for cleaner quest model focused on core requirements
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Simplified PartyMember from explicit permission flags to role-based system (OWNER/MODERATOR/MEMBER)
- **Party Status Streamlining**: Removed FORMING status, renamed DISBANDED to ARCHIVED with clear semantics (ACTIVE: normal function, COMPLETED: rating enabled + chat, ARCHIVED: read-only)
- **Clean Data Separation**: User model for capabilities, Quest model for requirements, matching happens at request time
- **UUID Primary Keys**: Maintaining existing UUID system for all models for better distributed scaling
- **Comprehensive Relationships**: Using SQLModel relationships with proper cascade rules for data integrity

### Performance Considerations
- **Vector Database Strategy**: Pinecone for semantic search with quest embeddings
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for frequent queries and session management  
- **Background Processing**: Celery for embedding generation and analytics
- **Database Indexing**: Strategic indexes on search and filter fields

### Security & Privacy
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth with refresh token rotation
- **Data Privacy**: User preferences kept local to search requests, not stored permanently
- **Permission System**: Role-based access control in party management
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Pydantic models
